## Why Medicus?

We've experienced an unprecedented Covid-19 pandemic in the last two years (2020/21). This virus outbreak has affected our lives and restricted people-to-people interaction. Social distancing has become the new norm. All of this in current internet age begs one important question. How can we use technology and make it easy for people to contact a health care physician while staying at their home?

This website provides you with an easy access to find a physician and receive health advice from them. Connect with them by scheduling quick appointments. Discuss your concerns by chatting with them and get your regular health update.
